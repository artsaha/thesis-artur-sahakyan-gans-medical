## Larger GAN Versions

This repository contains implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating larger images. The models are available in two versions:

- **Larger GAN Version 1**: Please refer to the notebook [wgan_128_v1.ipynb](./wgan_128_v1.ipynb) for the implementation details and usage instructions.
- **Larger GAN Version 2**: Please refer to the notebook [wgan_128_v2.ipynb](./wgan_128_v2.ipynb) for the implementation details and usage instructions.

## Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the GAN models, we use the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) scores. The evaluation results can be found in the `evaluations` folder.

For detailed FID scores and comparisons, please refer to the files within the [evaluations](./evaluations) directory.
